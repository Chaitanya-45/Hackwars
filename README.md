## Introduction

SvasthMaitri is a web-based platform developed to streamline the process of donating medicines. It allows users to fill out a form with details about the medicines they want to donate and submit it to the platform. The submitted information is then stored in a Firebase Realtime Database, where it can be accessed by administrators or relevant organizations to coordinate the donation process.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: The platform provides a simple and intuitive form for users to fill out with details about the medicines they wish to donate.
- **Realtime Database**: Utilizes Firebase Realtime Database to store and manage donation submissions, ensuring that information is updated and accessible in real time.
- **Cross-Origin Requests**: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is implemented to allow communication between the frontend and backend, enabling seamless form submission.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling is implemented on both frontend and backend to provide users with feedback in case of submission errors.
